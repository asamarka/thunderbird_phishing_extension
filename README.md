# Installation 

Put the folder with the extension files directly into Thunderbird's extensions folder

For Mac:
 /Macintosh HD/Users/<username>/Library//Thunderbird/Profiles/<Profile name>/extensions 

Then create a sub-folder with the name of my extension. This name must be exactly the same as the id of the <em:id> field in the install.rdf file
